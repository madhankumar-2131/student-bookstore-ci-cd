# CI/CD Pipeline for Student Bookstore Project

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD process. Every time changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the following actions are triggered:

## CI Workflow Steps:
1. **Checkout the code**: The workflow first checks out the latest version of the code from the `main` branch.
2. **Set up Node.js**: It sets up Node.js (version 16) to run the project.
3. **Install dependencies**: The project dependencies are installed using `npm install`.
4. **Run Tests**: Any test scripts are executed to ensure that the project is functioning correctly.
5. **Build the project**: The project is then built using the command `npm run build`. You can customize this command based on your project setup.
6. **Deploy (Optional)**: If needed, you can set up the deployment to Netlify by adding the necessary secrets (like `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`).

## GitHub Actions Setup:
The CI pipeline is triggered on every push to the `main` branch. The CI/CD workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow File:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main   # Trigger CI/CD on pushes to the main branch

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        npm test  # Ensure you have tests in your project. Adjust as needed.

    - name: Build the project
      run: |
        npm run build  # Adjust this command based on your project setup.
